	  Stuyvesant Lost and Found is a facebook app for all Stuyvesant students, where they can find any items they lost, or post any items they found.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This replaces the current system of posting items on facebook groups, which is year-specific and does not encompass all grades, and posts for lost or found items are quickly buried by other posts in the groups. However, it improves upon current system by integrating itself with facebook.
